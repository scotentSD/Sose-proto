## About the Prototype Kit

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

## Customising it for Scottish Enterprise
- change the **favicon** in the layout and add it to app>assets>images
- customise the **header** and the **footer** in the **layout** and create a special file for it: app>views>layout_se.html
- add **specific CSS** and link for it in layout_se.html: app>assets>sass>se.scss
- for the **breadcrumbs**, I modified the macro for the general template in node-modules>govuk-frontend>template.njk to be able to declare a block called "postHeader" to be generated just after the header. For more advanced behaviour I would need to change the existing macro for the breadcrumbs to add specific se classes in node-modules>govuk-frontend>components>breadcrumbs>template.njk 
- for the **change of template in govuk-frontend** to be taken into account, I need to change **gitignore** to push the changes in node_modules
- to be able to deploy to Heroku, I commented a line of code in:  node_nmodules>browser-sync>dist>index.js / it's password protected
